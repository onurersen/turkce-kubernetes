**What... is this thing?**

This repository keeps samples, scripts, notes belonging to my Youtube Channel "Türkçe Kubernetes".  
In English channel's name means "Kubernetes in Turkish".

I'm a fan of K8S.  
I try to create videos to explain easy to complex issues that I experience and solve  
through my journey with this technology.

If you want to check here is the [link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsuJZR9zQkyjmsAIvLQORgA "Türkçe Kubernetes")
Watch out all content stands to be in Turkish. ☺️
